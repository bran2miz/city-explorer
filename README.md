This application, City Explorer, utilizes the Axios library to render user's request for location data (such as the longitude and latitude and a map) from LocationIQ (third-party API)

## Getting Started

Step 1: **WhiteBoard**- ![WhiteBoard Image](./src/images/whiteboard.png)

Step 2: create react app then a repo and merge them together

Step 3: npm i react-bootstrap/Axios/

Step 4: Set up LocationIQ account and copy key

Step 5: create a skeleton exterior code (ie constructor function, render/return, header and footer components)/create .env file with key and value

Step 6: copy from bootstrap favored styled elements (I used container, row, and col)

Step 7: refer to notes to create a form/submit.

Step 8: Create a variable to pass the url to the api key name and the value. Add await response feature.
